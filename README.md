# LL(1) Calculator Parser

## _Academic Year of 2019-2020_

This project is about the implementation of a simple calculator, that should accept expressions with the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators, as well as parentheses. The parser reads its input from the standard input (e.g. via an InputStream on System.in) and writes the computed values of expressions to the standard output (System.out). Parse errors are being reported on standard error (System.err).
